Apache Pekko is an open-source framework for building applications that are concurrent, distributed, resilient and elastic.
Pekko uses the Actor Model to provide more intuitive high-level abstractions for concurrency.
Using these abstractions, Pekko also provides libraries for persistence, streams, HTTP, and more.

Pekko is part of the Apache Incubator program and we are actively working towards a v1.0 release. It's not yet ready for production use, but please get involved with the community and contribute to the effort.

Pekko is a fork of [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) 2.6.x, prior to the Akka project's adoption of the Business Source License.
