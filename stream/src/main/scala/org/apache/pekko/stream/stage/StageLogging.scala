/**
 * Simple way to obtain a [[pekko.event.LoggingAdapter]] when used together with an [[pekko.stream.Materializer]].
 * If used with a different materializer [[pekko.event.NoLogging]] will be returned.
 *
 * Make sure to only access `log` from GraphStage callbacks (such as `pull`, `push` or the async-callback).
 *
 * Note, abiding to [[pekko.stream.ActorAttributes.logLevels]] has to be done manually,
 * the logger itself is configured based on the logSource provided to it. Also, the `log`
 * itself would not know if you're calling it from a "on element" context or not, which is why
 * these decisions have to be handled by the operator itself.
