/**
 * A RestartSink wraps a [[Sink]] that gets restarted when it completes or fails.
 *
 * They are useful for graphs that need to run for longer than the [[Sink]] can necessarily guarantee it will, for
 * example, for [[Sink]] streams that depend on a remote server that may crash or become partitioned. The
 * RestartSink ensures that the graph can continue running while the [[Sink]] restarts.
 */
object RestartSink {

  /**
   * Wrap the given [[Sink]] with a [[Sink]] that will restart it when it fails or complete using an exponential
   * backoff.
   *
   * This [[Sink]] will not cancel as long as maxRestarts is not reached, since cancellation by the wrapped [[Sink]]
   * is handled by restarting it. The wrapped [[Sink]] can however be completed by feeding a completion or error into
   * this [[Sink]]. When that happens, the [[Sink]], if currently running, will terminate and will not be restarted.
   * This can be triggered simply by the upstream completing, or externally by introducing a [[KillSwitch]] right
   * before this [[Sink]] in the graph.
   *
   * The restart process is inherently lossy, since there is no coordination between cancelling and the sending of
   * messages. When the wrapped [[Sink]] does cancel, this [[Sink]] will backpressure, however any elements already
   * sent may have been lost.
   *
   * This uses the same exponential backoff algorithm as [[pekko.pattern.BackoffOpts]].
   *
   * @param settings [[RestartSettings]] defining restart configuration
   * @param sinkFactory A factory for producing the [[Sink]] to wrap.
