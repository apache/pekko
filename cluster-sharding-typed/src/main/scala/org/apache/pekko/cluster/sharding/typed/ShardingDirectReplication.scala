/**
 * INTERNAL API
 *
 * Used when sharding Replicated Event Sourced entities in multiple instances of sharding, for example one per DC in a Multi DC
 * Pekko Cluster.
 *
 * This actor should be started once on each node where Replicated Event Sourced entities will run (the same nodes that you start
 * sharding on). The entities should be set up with [[pekko.persistence.typed.scaladsl.EventSourcedBehavior.withEventPublishing]]
 * or [[pekko.persistence.typed.javadsl.ReplicatedEventSourcedBehavior#withEventPublishing()]]
 * If using [[ReplicatedSharding]] the replication can be enabled through [[ReplicatedEntityProvider.withDirectReplication]]
 * instead of starting this actor manually.
 *
 * Subscribes to locally written events through the event stream and sends the seen events to all the sharded replicas
 * which can then fast forward their cross-replica event streams to improve latency while allowing less frequent poll
 * for the cross replica queries. Note that since message delivery is at-most-once this can not be the only
 * channel for replica events - the entities must still tail events from the journals of other replicas.
 *
 * The events are forwarded as [[pekko.cluster.sharding.typed.ShardingEnvelope]] this will work out of the box both
 * by default and with a custom extractor since the envelopes are handled internally.
